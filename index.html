            <h4>What is misinformation?</h4>
            <p class="info"> Information disorder is the term often used to refer to the issue of misinformation on social media. It is the social danger that is the sharing or developing of false information either with or without the intent of harming others. This issue is interesting on a social level because in the current digital age, there exists an abundance of information on social media, always readily available for users to consume. <br> <br>
            With the growing use of social media and increased amount of information flowing in the form of easily digestible visuals and blurbs such as infographics, it’s easy to accept everything we see as true. However, the veracity of this information is not always clear which means that our target audience of high school and college-aged students may often be exposed to false information without their knowledge.</p><br>

            <h4 class="subheading">When did it begin?</h4>
            <p class="info">Misinformation isn’t new: propaganda has long been a tool to gain governmental compliance. In American journalistic history, misinformation has been producing mass hysteria for a long time, with newspapers finding it preferable to print stories before conducting fact-checks in order to gain a competitive advantage. <br><br>
            Since the 1900s, the growing availability of modern technology to mass produce print and film contributed to the increase in mass media, increasing access to cultural products, and gave rise to the 24 hour news cycle and the nationalization of news.</p><br>
            <h4>Where does it occur?</h4>
            <p class="info">Misinformation occurs everywhere, and it isn’t really new. Moral panics have long been created through misinformation. What is new is how misinformation is traveling faster than ever. People, instead of governments, are sharing misinformation. With the rise of social media, information is no longer held to the same reporting standards as traditional media. <br><br>
            Most misinformation occurs from some type of xenophobic sentiment, amplifies voices and stories that get the most views or attention, and pumps emotional content to draw more viewers, even if that content is off-putting. Media coverage is incentivized to direct attention towards extremism. <br><br>
            It’s not clear how much new technology has increased the prevalence of misinformation on social media, but we can say that social media as a vehicle is driving and contributing to the current crisis of misinformation.
