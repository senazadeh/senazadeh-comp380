            <ul>
              <li class="spaced noBullet"><b>Consider the Source:</b> Click away from the story to investigate the site, its mission, and contact info</li>
              <li class="spaced noBullet"><b>Read Beyond:</b> Headlines can be outrageous in an effort to get clicks. What’s the whole story?</li>
              <li class="spaced noBullet"><b>Check the Author:</b> Do a quick search on the author. Are they credible? Are they real?</li>
              <li class="spaced noBullet"><b>Supporting Sources?:</b> Click on those links!  Determine if the information given actually supports the story.</li>
              <li class="spaced noBullet"><b>Check the Date:</b> Reposting old news stories doesn’t mean they’re relevant to current events.</li>
              <li class="spaced noBullet"><b>Is it a Joke?:</b> If it’s too outlandish, it might be satire.  Research the site and author to be sure.</li>
              <li class="spaced noBullet"><b>Check Your Biases:</b> Consider your own beliefs could affect your judgement.</li>
              <li class="spaced noBullet"><b>Ask the Experts:</b> Ask a librarian, or consult a fact-checking site.</li>

            <h4>Lateral Reading</h4>
            <p class="info">We live in an era with information overabundance. This demands us to be more discerning. While browsing, researching, or reading anything online, we should always ask this one question: <b>Who’s behind the information?</b> Knowing where information comes from helps us know whether or not this information is reliable.  However, this is more easily said than done, especially online. This is often due to catfishing, where the people behind an article or website are pretending to be someone else.</p>

            <h5 class="info text-center quote">“Reading that way [vertically] gives misinformation and disinformation more power.  It allows people to hijack your consciousness, and it makes you part of the problem.”</h5>

            <p class="info">Most of the time, people read websites like they would a book or an article, top to bottom.  This is called <b>vertical reading</b>.  When you look at websites this way, they may seem more legitimate because you’re only seeing what their creators WANT you to see.  These creators also know what we think makes a website legitimate, a well-designed logo, references and citations, professional photography, etc.  This makes it harder for us to distinguish reliable and unreliable information.  However, when you introduce other strategies into your reading, like looking elsewhere for additional information, you can find out a lot more about the information you’re consuming.  When you’re on a new website, instead of just reading through and taking their word for it, you should leave, open a new tab and start looking for more information. This is called <b>lateral reading</b>.</p><br>

            <h4>How to Read Laterally</h4>
            <p class="info">When you first start to examine a website or other piece of information on the web, open another tab and search the website or organization’s name.  In the results, look for reliable sources for more information about the website/organization.</p>
            
            <h6 class="info">Reliable sources may include:</h6>
            <ul>
              <li class="spaced">Newspapers</li>
              <li class="spaced">Magazines and Digital News*</li>
              <li class="spaced">Fact-Checking Websites</li>
              <li class="spaced">Wikipedia**</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="indented">
              <sub>*Keep in mind many online news organizations have their own points of view as well<br>
                **Yes, contrary to popular belief, Wikipedia is a great way to start your research!  Although Wikipedia CAN be wrong and CAN be edited by anyone, it is also the largest general reference work on the web.  Wikipedia articles are subject to editing standards.  Some pages on Wikipedia do not meet these standards, which they state at the top of the page, but the ones that do are well sourced and should give you a list of citations that work.</sub>
            </div><br>

            <p class="info">Once you start examining your first source, look for names of other websites, organizations, or people linked to the original organization.  With this new piece of information, open up a new tab and repeat the process again.  Continue this until you feel like you have a full scope of where this information is coming from and why.  Understanding who is sharing information and why can help you to evaluate what you’re reading and place it in its proper context.</p><br>

            <h4>Click Restraint</h4>
            <p class="info">When using a search engine, most people believe the top result is the most trustworthy.  However, this is usually not the case.  Keywords, metadata, companies engaging in search engine optimization, and advertisements sometimes push less trustworthy sources above more reliable ones.  Because of this, search engines are not truth detectors and the information they present needs to be deciphered.  In order to avoid accidentally clicking on unreliable information, examine the titles, urls, and snippets to find clues on whether or not the link you’re clicking on is from a trusted source.  This is called click restraint.  By engaging in click restraint, you’ll get a general sense of  information you’ll be looking at before clicking on any result.<br><br>
            Go to a search engine and look up a topic you want to know about.  Before clicking on anything, scan the list of results.

            <h4>How to Practice Click Restraint</h4>
            <p class="info">Go to a search engine and look up a topic you want to know about.  Before clicking on anything, scan the list of results.</p>
            <h6 class="info">Examine the following:</h6>
            <ul>
              <li class="spaced">Titles</li>
              <li class="spaced">Authors</li>
              <li class="spaced">Snippets</li>
            </ul>
            <h6 class="info">And ask yourself the following questions:</h6>
            <ul>
              <li class="spaced">Are certain groups trying to influence the conversations?</li>
              <li class="spaced">Might it be helpful to go to the second page of results?</li>
              <li class="spaced">What clues are there about whether this is a trustworthy source?</li>
              <li class="spaced">What clues are there about what kind of evidence it might provide?</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="info">The best possible website would be trustworthy and present a balanced view on the topic you’re researching.  By just spending 15 to 30 seconds examining search results can make a big difference in your ability to avoid misleading sources online and find trustworthy ones.</p><br>
