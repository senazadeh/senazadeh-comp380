            <h2>Facebook and Twitter</h2>
            <p class="info">When perusing through a feed, a user gets signals from the environment and their peers and translates these signals into decisions, such as a like or comment. The current state of social media gives people access to signals from large numbers of people. AI uses engagement signals for recommendation algorithms, the order you see posts on news feeds, suggesting friends you may know, etc. Social media and news recommendation systems have a strong popularity bias because they utilize this AI driven by engagement cues. Interacting with a post by liking, commenting, and sharing triggers engagement signals accordingly.<br><br>

            Facebook and Twitter both rely on AI algorithms to rank and recommend content. The goal of their algorithm is to maximize engagement to keep the users on their platform by finding out what people like and ranking it at the top of their feeds. Therefore it becomes  dangerous when a user starts interacting with misinformation from those in their circle. It causes further misinformation to find its way into their newsfeed feed, when said information is seen repetitively, it's easy to overlook its potential lack of accuracy. <br><br>
            
            Once a false message is out, it's easy for it to diffuse and get picked up in news coverage and publications that then get referenced back in social media posts. Ultimately, misinformation has the greatest chance of getting widespread when it contains content that exploits feelings of superiority, anger, or fear against another group.
