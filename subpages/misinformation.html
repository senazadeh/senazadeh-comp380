          <h2>Echo Chambers and Misinformation</h2>
          <p class="info">Social media continues to serve as a vehicle for disseminating large volumes of information to greater audiences as an alternative to traditional news sources. An effect of this is the spread of misinformation, as well as less exposure to diverse opinions and differing perspectives, resulting in echo chambers.</p><br>
          
          <h4>What is an echo chamber</h4>
          <p class="info">Echo chambers are defined as a “place in which people only encounter beliefs, opinions, or views that reflect and reinforce their own” (Jiang et al, 2021). The 2016 US presidential election and the COVID-19 “infodemic” are proof that misinformation is present and active in social media, the algorithms that influence our social feeds being a major factor in the exacerbation of these echo chambers that are deepening the divide between users of differing opinions and stances.</p><br>

          <h4>Misinformation Diffusion</h4>
          <p class="info">Echo chambers have been characterized by diffusion of misinformation. Since social media platforms are easily accessible, content is becoming increasingly easy to disseminate. As a byproduct of this accessibility, online platforms lack regulation, meaning that the credibility and often the accuracy of content is of lower quality than traditional news media. Echo chambers contribute to this phenomenon by excluding differing opinions, promoting confirmation bias, and permitting misinformation to obtain virality.<br><br>
          Online discussions of misinformation or misinformed content is often sparked by heated discussions and debates, which has led to emotionally charged conversations online<br><br>
          Misinformation is more likely to be associated with negative emotions (anger, sadness, etc). If a piece of misinformation has more anger, it is more likely to reach a greater audience/e spread among greater social networks</p><br>

          <h4>Emotional Contagion</h4>
          <p class="info">Extreme emotions are exposed and echoed by echo chambers, and are usually caused by users who continually receive or consume misleading content and conspiracy theories. In other words, those who are more likely to view controversial and conspiracy topics or misinformation are more affected by it.<br><br>
          Ahmed et al. conducted a COVID-19 case study in China, investigating young people aged 21-40 years old who suffered psychological repercussions during COVID-19 pandemic. The study assessed the mental health status of Chinese people, and showed higher rates of anxiety, depression, harmful alcohol use, and low mental wellbeing.</p><br>
